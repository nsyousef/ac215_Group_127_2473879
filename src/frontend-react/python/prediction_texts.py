PREDICTION_TEXT_MAP = {
    "melanoma": "Melanoma is a serious skin cancer that arises from pigment-producing melanocytes, often due to ultraviolet (UV) damage. It is less common than other skin cancers but far more dangerous because it can spread quickly if undetected. Risk factors include fair skin, numerous moles, and family history. Early detection greatly improves outcomes, and modern treatments have recently lowered mortality.",
    "cutaneous-lymphoma": "Cutaneous lymphoma is a cancer of lymphocytes that primarily affects the skin, most commonly presenting as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. It often appears as scaly red patches, plaques, or tumors and usually follows a chronic course. The causes are not well understood, and it is unrelated to sun exposure. Most cases are indolent but require ongoing monitoring and treatment to control symptoms.",
    "squamous-cell-carcinoma": "Squamous cell carcinoma is a common skin cancer that develops from sun-damaged squamous cells, usually on exposed areas like the face or arms. It often appears as a scaly red bump or patch that may crust or ulcerate. Although usually less dangerous than melanoma, SCC can grow aggressively and occasionally metastasize. Early surgical removal is highly effective in most cases.",
    "basal-cell-carcinoma": "Basal cell carcinoma is the most common skin cancer and arises from basal cells in the epidermis, typically due to long-term sun exposure. It often looks like a pearly bump or scaly patch, especially on the face or neck. BCC grows slowly and very rarely spreads, but it can cause local tissue damage if ignored. Treatment is usually straightforward, most often through minor surgical removal.",
    "benign-nevus": "A benign nevus is a common mole formed from clusters of melanocytes and appears as a small, evenly colored spot. Most adults have many nevi, which usually develop during childhood or adolescence. These lesions are harmless and stable over time. Monitoring is recommended only for changes that might suggest transformation into melanoma, which is rare.",
    "seborrheic-keratosis": "Seborrheic keratosis is a very common benign skin growth with a waxy, wart-like, 'stuck-on' appearance. It typically occurs on the trunk, face, or back in middle-aged and older adults. The cause is unknown, but it is a normal sign of aging and not related to skin cancer. Removal is optional and done mainly for irritation or cosmetic reasons.",
    "benign-keratosis": "Benign keratosis refers to non-cancerous keratin-producing growths such as seborrheic keratoses, solar lentigines, and lichen planus-like keratoses. These lesions often look scaly or wart-like and are linked to aging and sun exposure. They are harmless and do not become cancerous, though they may resemble malignancies. Dermatologists sometimes biopsy them to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "hyperpigmentation": "Hyperpigmentation describes darkened areas of skin caused by excess melanin. It may result from sun exposure, hormonal changes, inflammation, or certain medications. The condition is common across all skin types and is generally harmless. Treatments focus on fading the pigment and preventing recurrence through sun protection and topical or procedural therapies.",
    "lipoma": "A lipoma is a benign tumor composed of soft, movable fat tissue beneath the skin. These lumps grow slowly, are usually painless, and often occur on the trunk, shoulders, or arms. The cause is unclear, though some people develop multiple lipomas. They are harmless and removed only if bothersome, painful, or cosmetically undesirable.",
    "granuloma-annulare": "Granuloma annulare is a benign skin condition characterized by smooth, ring-shaped bumps, commonly on the hands, feet, or elbows. Its cause is unknown, though mild trauma or immune factors may contribute. The condition is usually asymptomatic and often resolves on its own over months or years. Treatment is optional and may include topical or injected steroids for persistent or widespread cases.",
    "wart-hpv": "Warts are benign skin growths caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), producing rough, raised bumps on the skin. They can occur on the hands, feet, face, or other areas and spread through direct contact. Warts are extremely common and often resolve on their own as the immune system clears the virus. Treatments like salicylic acid or cryotherapy help remove persistent or bothersome lesions.",
    "skin-tag": "Skin tags are soft, harmless growths that hang from the skin by a thin stalk, commonly found on the neck, armpits, and groin. They are very common in adults and are associated with friction, aging, and metabolic factors. Skin tags cause no medical problems unless irritated. Removal is optional and typically done for comfort or cosmetic reasons.",
    "trauma": "In dermatology, trauma refers to any physical injury to the skin, such as cuts, scrapes, burns, or surgical wounds. These injuries trigger a healing response that may include scabbing, inflammation, or scarring. Most minor trauma heals well with proper wound care. More significant injuries can lead to complications like infection or persistent scarring.",
    "epidermal-cyst": "An epidermal cyst is a common benign bump formed when skin cells become trapped beneath the surface, creating a keratin-filled sac. These cysts appear as firm, round nodules, often with a visible pore. They are usually harmless but can become inflamed or infected. Treatment is unnecessary unless they are painful or growing, in which case surgical removal is curative.",
    "dermatofibroma": "A dermatofibroma is a small, firm, benign skin nodule that most often arises on the legs. It may dimple inward when pinched, which is a characteristic feature. These growths likely develop after minor skin injury and remain stable over time. They are harmless and removed only if symptomatic or cosmetically bothersome.",
    "hair-follicle-tumor": "Hair follicle tumors are usually benign growths arising from components of the hair follicle, such as pilomatricomas or trichoepitheliomas. They present as slow-growing nodules that may be skin-colored or slightly blueish. These tumors are uncommon and typically solitary. Surgical removal is curative and often performed to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "pyogenic-granuloma": "A pyogenic granuloma is a benign, rapidly growing red bump made of small blood vessels that bleeds easily. It often appears after minor trauma or during pregnancy. Although harmless, the lesion rarely resolves on its own and frequently recurs if irritated. Treatment usually involves surgical removal or cautery to control bleeding and prevent regrowth.",
    "neurofibroma": "A neurofibroma is a benign tumor arising from nerve sheath cells, presenting as a soft, button-like bump in the skin. Most occur as isolated lesions, though multiple neurofibromas are seen in neurofibromatosis type 1. They are typically painless and grow slowly. Removal is only needed if the lesion is symptomatic or undesired.",
    "sweat-gland-tumor": "Sweat gland tumors arise from eccrine or apocrine glands and are usually benign, such as syringomas or hidradenomas. These growths appear as small nodules or bumps and tend to enlarge slowly over time. They are relatively uncommon and often diagnosed by biopsy due to their resemblance to other lesions. Treatment is usually surgical removal if they cause irritation or cosmetic concern.",
    "fungal-infection": "Fungal skin infections are extremely common and include conditions such as ringworm, athlete’s foot, and yeast-related rashes. They thrive in warm, moist environments and often cause itching, redness, or scaling. Most are superficial and easily treated with topical or oral antifungal medications. Good hygiene and keeping the skin dry help prevent recurrence.",
    "lymphocytic-infiltrations": "Lymphocytic infiltrations are conditions in which lymphocytes accumulate in the skin, often forming bumps or plaques that can resemble lymphoma. These reactions may be triggered by medications, infections, or occur without a clear cause. Diagnosis often requires a biopsy to distinguish them from true cutaneous lymphoma. Most cases are benign and treated with topical therapies or by removing the underlying trigger.",
    "prurigo": "Prurigo refers to intensely itchy skin bumps or nodules brought on by repeated scratching. Prurigo nodularis, the most recognized form, creates firm, itchy nodules on the arms or legs. The exact cause is unclear, but chronic itch-scratch cycles and underlying medical conditions may play a role. Treatment focuses on reducing itch and inflammation so the skin can heal.",
    "kaposi-sarcoma": "Kaposi sarcoma is a cancer of blood vessel–lining cells caused by human herpesvirus-8, most often seen in people with weakened immune systems.

Treatment includes improving immune function when possible and using chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation for active lesions.",
    "scar-fibrosis": "Scar fibrosis occurs when collagen builds up during healing after injury, surgery, or inflammation. Scars may be flat, raised (hypertrophic), or extend beyond the wound (keloids). These changes are harmless but can be uncomfortable or cosmetically concerning. Treatments like silicone therapy, steroid injections, and lasers can help improve appearance and reduce symptoms.",
    "vascular-tumor": "Vascular tumors arise from blood or lymphatic vessels and range from common benign lesions to rare malignancies. Infantile hemangiomas and cherry angiomas are typical benign examples that often require no treatment. Malignant vascular tumors like angiosarcoma are rare but aggressive. Management depends on type, with benign tumors often observed and malignant ones treated surgically or with systemic therapy.",
    "metastatic-carcinoma": "Metastatic carcinoma to the skin occurs when cancer from another organ spreads to the skin. It usually presents as firm, painless nodules or plaques and indicates advanced disease. Breast, lung, and colorectal cancers are the most common sources. Treatment focuses on managing the underlying cancer and may include local measures for comfort.",
    "folliculitis": "Folliculitis is inflammation or infection of hair follicles, producing small red bumps or pustules. It commonly results from bacteria, yeast, friction, or shaving. Most cases are mild and resolve with hygiene measures or topical treatments. Persistent or deep infections may need oral medication or drainage.",
    "dysplastic-nevus": "A dysplastic nevus is an atypical mole with irregular borders or coloration, yet it is still benign. People with multiple dysplastic nevi have a higher risk of melanoma and often require regular skin checks. These nevi are usually stable but may be photographed or biopsied if concerning changes occur. Excision is recommended only when features suggest possible progression.",
    "xanthogranuloma": "Juvenile xanthogranuloma is a benign skin lesion seen mostly in infants and young children, appearing as a small yellow-orange or reddish bump. It typically arises on the head, neck, or trunk. The condition is harmless and most lesions regress spontaneously over a few years. Treatment is rarely needed unless the lesion affects a sensitive area, such as the eye.",
    "eczema-dermatitis": "Eczema, or dermatitis, is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, itchy, and sometimes oozing patches.
