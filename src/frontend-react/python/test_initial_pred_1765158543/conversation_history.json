      "message": "Hi there! It looks like you might have a seborrheic keratosis, which is a very common, harmless skin growth. It's basically like a little skin tag, but often a bit flatter and can be brown, black, or tan.\n\nBased on the picture and what you've told me, the spot is about the size of a coin, light brown, and has an irregular shape. It seems like a pretty typical presentation for this type of growth.\n\nSeborrheic keratoses are super common, especially as we get a little older. They aren't caused by anything specific, like sun exposure or genetics, but they tend to appear more often on areas like the chest, back, and face. They aren't contagious, so you definitely didn't catch it from anyone!\n\nFor home care, there isn't much you need to do, as they're usually harmless. You can gently wash the area with mild soap and water, and keep it moisturized like the rest of your skin. Avoid picking or scratching at it, as that can cause irritation. If it bothers you cosmetically, you can try covering it with makeup.\n\nWhile these spots are generally not a concern, it's always a good idea to have any new or changing skin spots checked by a doctor, just to be sure. If the spot starts to change quickly in size, shape, or color, or if it becomes itchy, painful, or bleeds, definitely make an appointment.\n\nPlease remember, I'm just an assistant, and this isn't a formal diagnosis. A doctor can give you a definitive answer and discuss any treatment options if you're interested.",
