They have the tools and expertise to properly examine the spot, potentially using a dermatoscope, and determine if it needs a biopsy.\n\nDon't panic, but please don't wait too long to get it checked out. Early detection is key for many skin conditions, including melanoma. While I can't diagnose anything, those features we noted are definitely worth having a professional look at. They can give you a definitive answer and discuss the best course of action, whether it's just monitoring or further treatment. Taking this step will give you peace of mind either way!",
