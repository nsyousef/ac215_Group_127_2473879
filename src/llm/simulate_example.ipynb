Based on what you've described, the patch on your elbow seems to be quite red and covers a noticeable area.\\n\\nThe image and your history suggest a flare-up of irritated skin. It's good you noticed it gets worse with scented soap and hot showers, as those are common triggers. The dryness and scaling fit with eczema, and it's helpful that it's not painful or bleeding right now.\\n\\nEczema often happens because of a combination of things. Sometimes it's related to genetics, meaning it runs in families. Other times, it's triggered by things that irritate the skin, like certain soaps, detergents, or even weather changes. Stress can also sometimes play a role.\\n\\nTo help soothe the skin at home, try using a gentle, fragrance-free cleanser instead of your usual soap. After bathing, gently pat your skin dry and immediately apply a thick, plain moisturizer to help lock in moisture. Taking shorter, lukewarm showers instead of hot ones can also make a big difference.\\n\\nYou should definitely see a doctor if the patch gets much worse, starts to ooze or bleed, or if it doesn't improve after a week or two of home care. Also, if the itching becomes really bothersome and keeps you up at night, it's a good idea to get it checked out.\\n\\nPlease remember, I'm just an assistant, and this isn't a formal diagnosis. A healthcare professional can give you the best advice for your specific situation.\",\n",
