# Encoder configuration
# IMPORTANT: If you change the model_name, max_length, pooling_type, etc. you must also change the 
# pre_existing_path. Otherwise, the dataloader will just load the existing embeddings (computed with the previous model), 
# instead of re-computing them with the new model. To make the configuration recompute the embeddings each time, set
# pre_existing_path to null. This will not save the embeddings and will force a recompute from scratch.
encoder:
  pre_existing_path: null # The path to which to store the embeddings (to store in Google cloud, begin path with gs://<bucket-name>/). Set to null to not save embeddings anywhere.
  model_name: "pubmedbert" # or biosyn, sapbert, qwen, or path to a model
  max_length: 512 # Maximum sequence length
  pooling_type: "cls" # One of 'mean', 'cls', 'last_token'
  batch_size: 32 # The batch size to use when creating embeddings
  qwen_instr: "Represent the patient's description and characteristics (including clinical details, age, sex, and symptoms) as a semantic embedding suitable for clinical classification. Return an embedding." # The instructions for the QWEN embedding to use (allows us to experiment with different instructions; ignored if model is not QWEN)
